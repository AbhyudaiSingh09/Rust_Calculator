# Rust_Calculator
## Calculator Application

This is a simple command-line calculator application implemented in Rust. It provides four different calculator functionalities: Print Stack, Arithmetic Calculator, Bitwise Calculator, and Negate Calculator. You can select the desired calculator functionality by entering the corresponding number.

### How to Run the Application

To run the calculator application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository containing the code.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Compile the code by running the command `cargo build`.
5. Run the application using the command `cargo run`.

### Functionality

1. **Print Stack**: Selecting option 1 will print the stack.
2. **Arithmetic Calculator**: Selecting option 2 allows you to perform arithmetic calculations. You will be prompted to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %). The application will display the result of the calculation.
3. **Bitwise Calculator**: Selecting option 3 enables you to perform bitwise calculations. You will be prompted to enter two numbers and an operator (&, |, <<, >>). The application will display the result of the bitwise operation.
4. **Negate Calculator**: Selecting option 4 allows you to negate a number. You will be prompted to enter a number, and the application will display the negation of the number.

Please note that the application expects valid input for each calculator functionality. Any invalid input may result in unexpected behavior.

Feel free to explore and use the calculator application for your calculations!
